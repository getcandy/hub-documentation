The Admin Hub is a first-party NuxtJS SPA that is being developed and maintained by GetCandy. As we're working with an API, creating a decoupled admin system for you made perfect sense. It means you can easily scale your API without having to worry about your admin hub being married to your Laravel app.

Once caveat that could be argued is there is a learning curve to getting set up with NuxtJS & Vue, especially if you're new to these systems, but we believe the benefits are plentiful and we think you'll agree too as you begin your journey with us.
